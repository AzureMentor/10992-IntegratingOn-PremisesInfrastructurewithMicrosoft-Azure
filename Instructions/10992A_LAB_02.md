## Exercise 1: Preparing for an upload of a virtual disk file to Azure
  
### Scenario
  
A. Datum Corporation configures its Hyper-V virtual disk files in the .vhdx format. You realize that Azure requires that its virtual machine disk files are in the .vhd format. You plan to first create a sample fixed .vhdx file and test converting it to the .vhd format. Next, you will create an Azure storage account where the virtual disk file will reside after the upload. 

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.   Create an Azure storage account
2.   Create a .vhdx virtual disk
3.   Convert the .vhdx virtual disk to the .vhd format


#### Task 1: Create an Azure storage account
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, start Internet Explorer, browse to the Azure portal, and then sign in by using the Microsoft account that is either the Service Administrator or Co-Administrator of your Azure subscription.
2.   From the Azure portal, create a new storage account with the following settings:

  -   Name: a unique name from 3 through 24 characters that includes lowercase letters and digits.

  -   Deployment model:  **Resource Manager**

  -   Account kind:  **General purpose**

  -   Performance:  **Standard**

  -   Replication:  **Locally-redundant storage (LRS)**

  -   Storage service encryption:  **Disabled**

  -   Subscription: the name of your Azure subscription

  -   Resource group: a new resource group named  **UploadedVHDRG**

  -   Location: An Azure region close to the location of your lab VM

  -   Pin to dashboard: leave cleared


3.   Do not wait until the storage account is created, but proceed to the next task.


#### Task 2: Create a .vhdx virtual disk
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, start Computer Management.
2.   In the  **Computer Management** console, click **Disk Management**.
3.   From the  **Disk Management** snap-in of the **Computer Management** console, create a new virtual disk with the following settings:

  -   Location:  **D:\Mod02\Labfiles\LabDisk.vhdx**

  -   Virtual hard disk size:  **1** **GB**

  -   Virtual hard disk format:  **VHDX**

  -   Virtual hard disk type:  **Fixed size**


4.   Detach the newly created disk.
5.   Close  **Computer Management**.


#### Task 3: Convert the .vhdx virtual disk to the .vhd format
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, start Windows PowerShell as an administrator.
2.   At the  **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** prompt, run the following cmdlet,

  ```
  Convert-VHD -Path D:\Mod02\Labfiles\LabDisk.vhdx -DestinationPath D:\Mod02\Labfiles\LabDisk.vhd
  ```

3.   Wait until the conversion completes. This should take a few seconds

>  **Result**: After you complete this exercise, you should have successfully created an Azure storage account, created a fixed .vhdx virtual disk file, and converted it to the .vhd format.


## Exercise 2: Uploading a virtual disk file to Azure
  
### Scenario
  
Now that you converted the virtual disk file to the .vhd format and created an Azure storage account, you are ready to upload the .vhd file. You will accomplish this by using the AzCopy.exe utility.

A. Datum Corporation wants to minimize the cost associated with testing Azure capabilities. You need to identify and delete all the resources you deploy during your tests.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.   Upload the .vhd file to the Azure storage account
2.   Identify and delete all the Azure resources used in the lab


#### Task 1: Upload the .vhd file to the Azure storage account
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, switch to the Internet Explorer window showing the Azure portal and navigate to the storage account you created in the first exercise of this lab.
2.   Copy the value of key1 of the storage account to Clipboard.
3.   At the  **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** prompt, sign in to the Azure subscription by using the Microsoft account that is the Service Administrator or Co-Administrator of your Azure subscription.
    >  **Note:** If prompted whether to enable data collection, type N and press Enter.

4.   If you have multiple subscriptions, then at the  **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** prompt, run the following cmdlet (where _Your_Azure_subscription_name_ designates the name of your Azure subscription).

  ```
  Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionName 'Your_Azure_subscription_name'
  ```
5.   At the  **Administrator: Windows PowerShell**, run the following cmdlet.

  ```
  $storageAccount = Get-AzureRmStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName 'UploadedVHDRG'
  ```
6.   At the  **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** prompt, change the current directory to **C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\AzCopy**.
7.   At the  **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** prompt, run the following cmdlet.

  ```
  .\AzCopy.exe /Source:"D:\Mod02\Labfiles" /Dest:"https://$($storageAccount.StorageAccountName).blob.core.windows.net/vhds" /DestKey:storage_account_key /BlobType:page /Pattern:"LabDisk.vhd" /Y
  ```
>  **Note:** Because AzCopy copies only the content of the VHD file that is in use, the upload should take a few seconds.


#### Task 2: Identify and delete all the Azure resources used in the lab
  
1.   From the Azure portal, delete the  **UploadedVHDRG** resource group.
2.   Close all open windows.

>  **Result**: After you complete this exercise, you should have successfully uploaded the .vhd file to an Azure storage account. After the upload completes, you should have identified and removed all of the Azure resources that you created for this lab by using the Azure portal.



## 
  
**Question** 
What type of conversion is necessary prior to uploading virtual disk files to an Azure storage account?

**Question** 
What would be your primary considerations when downloading virtual disk files from Azure to your on-premises computers?



# Lab B: Moving containers between on-premises Hyper-V virtual machines and Azure virtual machines
  
### Scenario
  
A. Datum Corporation wants to implement some of its workloads as Docker containers. The intention is to host the same containers in Azure virtual machines and in on-premises virtual machines. A. Datum Corporation also wants to deploy its own private Docker Registry to store containerized images. Your task is to determine what tools you can use to deploy the containers in a hybrid environment. You also need to evaluate the use of a private Docker Registry. 


### Objectives

## Exercise 1: Creating a Docker host by using Docker Machine
  
### Scenario
  
To test the planned deployment, you must identify the tool that will allow you to deploy Docker hosts to both Azure virtual machines and on-premises Hyper-V virtual machines. You decide to evaluate the Docker Toolbox for Windows. After you deploy the two Docker host virtual machines, you intend to use Docker Machine, included in the Docker Toolbox, to verify that they are both operational. To accomplish this, you want to install and run a sample containerized web server named nginx, which is available from GitHub, on each one.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.   Install Docker Toolbox for Windows
2.   Create a Docker host in a Hyper-V virtual machine by using Docker Machine 
3.   Create a Docker host in an Azure virtual machine by using Docker Machine

Wait for the new Hyper-V virtual machine to be provisioned. This takes a few minutes. If the Boot2Docker ISO image is out-of-date, Docker Machine initiates the download of the latest release. 
>  **Note:** Disregard the message **Error creating machine: Error detecting OS: OS type not recognized** at the end of the provisioning process.


#### Task 3: Create a Docker host in an Azure virtual machine by using Docker Machine
  
1.   On  **MIA-CL1**, at the  **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** prompt, sign in to the Azure subscription by using the Microsoft account that is the Service Administrator or Co-Administrator of your Azure subscription.
2.   In the output of the cmdlet, note the value of the  **SubscriptionId** property.
3.   On  **MIA-CL1**, at the command prompt, run the following command (replace `<location>` with the name of the Azure region in which you want to provision the new Azure VM, `<vm_size`> with the VM size that you can provision in that Azure region, `<subscription_id>` with the value of your Azure subscription ID, which you identified in the previous step, and `<16.04.0-DAILY-LTS`> with the Ubuntu Server image version provided by the instructor): 

  ```
  docker-machine create --driver azure --azure-size "<vm_size>" --azure-ssh-user ops --azure-subscription-id "<subscription_id>" --azure-open-port 80 --azure-open-port 8080 --azure-image canonical:UbuntuServer:16.04-LTS:latest --azure-location "<location>" azuredockervm
  ```

4.   Follow the instructions displayed at the command prompt that state that you should use a web browser to open the page at 
        [https://aka.ms/devicelogin](https://aka.ms/devicelogin)
      , and then enter the code provided at the end of the message. On MIA-CL1, start Internet Explorer, and then browse to 
        [https://aka.ms/devicelogin](https://aka.ms/devicelogin)
      . On the  **Device Login** page, type the code displayed at the command prompt, and then click **Continue**.
5.   On the  **Docker Machine for Azure** page, sign in by using the Microsoft account that is either the Service Administrator or Co-Administrator of your Azure subscription.
6.   On the  **Docker Machine for Azure** page, click **Accept**.
7.   Switch back to the command prompt, and then monitor the progress of provisioning the Azure virtual machine.
8.   Wait for the new Docker Azure VM to be provisioned. 
9.   At the command prompt, run the following command. 

  ```
  docker-machine ls
  ```
10.   Verify that the output includes both the Hyper-V virtual machine and the Azure VM. 
11.   At the command prompt, run the following command. 

  ```
  docker-machine env azuredockervm
  ```
  If you receive an error checking the TLS connection, run the following command at the command prompt to regenerate the TLS certificates.

  ```

12.   Review the output returned by the  **docker-machine env** command.
13.   At the command prompt, run the following command. 

  ```
  @FOR /f "tokens=*" %i IN ('docker-machine env azuredockervm') DO @%i
  ```


#### Task 4: Run a container in a Docker host running in a Hyper-V virtual machine
  
1.   On  **MIA-CL1**, from Server Manager, start Hyper-V Manager. 
2.   In the  **Hyper-V Manager** window, connect to the console of **localdockervm**. 
3.   At the command prompt in the console of the  **localdockervm**, run the following command. 

  ```
  docker run -d -p 80:80 --restart=always nginx
  ```

  Wait until the container for nginx is downloaded and started on the Docker host virtual machine. This might take a few minutes depending on the available bandwidth.

4.   To obtain the IP address of the target Docker virtual machine hosting the containerized application, run the following command at the command prompt on  **localdockervm**.

  ```
  ifconfig eth0
  ```

  Look at the second line of the output, and note the IP address following the  **inet addr:** string.

5.   On MIA-CL1, start Internet Explorer, and then browse to the IP address you obtained in the previous step. Verify that Internet Explorer displays the  **Welcome to nginx** page.

3.   To obtain the IP address of the target Docker Azure virtual machine that hosts the containerized application, at the command prompt, run 

  ```
  docker-machine ip azuredockervm
  ```

4.   On MIA-CL1, start Internet Explorer, and then browse to the IP address you obtained in the previous step. Verify that Internet Explorer displays the  **Welcome to nginx** page.

>  **Result**: After you complete this exercise, you should have successfully installed Docker Toolbox for Windows, created a Docker host in a Hyper-V virtual machine by using Docker Machine, created a Docker host in an Azure virtual machine by using Docker Machine, and run a sample containerized web server nginx on both Docker host virtual machines.


## Exercise 2: Deploying a private Docker Registry in Azure
  
### Scenario
  
Now that you have successfully implemented a Docker host in an on-premises Hyper-V virtual machine and in an Azure virtual machine, you want to test the setup and image deployment by using a private Docker Registry in Azure. To simplify your tests, you will use a small, sample hello-world image available from the Docker Hub Registry. You will start by creating a private registry hosted in an Azure storage account. You will then download the sample image to your lab computer and upload it to the newly created private registry. Finally, you will deploy the image from the private registry to both the Azure and the on-premises Docker hosts.

Because A. Datum Corporation wants to minimize the cost associated with testing Azure capabilities, you will identify and delete all the resources you deploy during your tests.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.   Create an Azure storage account
2.   Deploy a private Docker Registry
3.   Upload an image to the private Docker Registry
4.   Download and deploy images from the private Docker Registry
5.   Identify and delete all lab Azure resources
6.   Prepare for the next lab


#### Task 1: Deploy a private Docker Registry
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, in the Internet Explorer window, in the Azure portal, create a new **Azure Container Registry** with the following settings:

  -   Registry name: a unique name consisting of between 5 and 50 alphanumeric characters

  -   Subscription: the name of the Azure subscription you are using in this lab

  -   Resource group: create a new resource group named **DockerRegistryRG**

  -   Location : select any Azure location where you can create an Azure Container Registry, preferably the same one hosting the Azure VM you deployed earlier in this exercise

  -   Admin user: **Enable** (this allows you to use the registry name as username and admin user access key as password to access the registry)

  -   SKU : **Basic**

2.   Wait for the operation to complete.


#### Task 2: Identify Azure Container Registry authentication settings.
  
1.   In the Azure portal, navigate to the blade of the Azure container registry you created in the previous task.
2.   On the container registry blade, copy the container registry password to Clipboard. 
3.   Note the values of the **Username** and the **Login server** entries. The username should match the registry name and the login server name should consist of the registry name followed by the **.azurecr.io** suffix.


#### Task 3: Upload an image to the private Docker Registry
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, in the **Administrator: Command Prompt** window, log in to the Azure Container registry you created in the first task by running the `docker login` command, providing the value of the `login-server` parameter you identified in the previous task as well as the following parameters:

  - `--username`: **Username** you identified in the previous task

  - `--password`: **password** you copied to Clipboard in the previous task

2.   Ensure that you receive the **Login succeeded** message. Next, pull the **microsoft/aci-helloworld** image from Docker Hub by running the `docker pull` command from the **Administrator: Command Prompt** window. 
3.   Wait for the image to be downloaded to the Docker Azure VM. Next, tag the image with the Azure Container registry name by running from the **Administrator: Command Prompt** window the `docker tag` command with the `<login-server>/aci-helloworld:v1` parameter, replacing the `<login-server>` entry with the value you identified in the previous task.
4.   Push the tagged image to the Azure Container registry by running from the **Administrator: Command Prompt** window the `docker push` command with the `<login-server>/aci-helloworld:v1` parameter, replacing the `<login-server>` entry with the value you identified in the previous task.
5.   Wait for the image to be pushed to the registry. Next, in the Azure portal, from the container registry blade, verify that the Azure Container registry contains the **aci-helloworld** repository



#### Task 4: Download and deploy images from the private Docker Registry
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, from the **Administrator: Command Prompt** window, pull the newly tagged image from the Azure Container registry, by running from the **Administrator: Command Prompt** window the `docker pull` command with the `<login-server>/aci-helloworld:v1` parameter, replacing the `<login-server>` entry with the value you identified earlier in this exercise.
2.   Note that the image does not need to be downloaded, since it is already present on the target Docker Azure VM. 
3.   Deploy the image downloaded from the Azure Container registry, by running from the **Administrator: Command Prompt** window the `docker run` command with the `<login-server>/aci-helloworld:v1` parameter, replacing the `<login-server>` entry with the value you identified earlier in this exercise. Deploy the web service running in the container such that it is accessible via port **8080**. 
4.   Run the `docker ps` command to verify that the image has been successfully deployed.
5.   Note that the output includes the tagged image. 
6.   To access the running container, switch to the Internet Explorer window displaying the **Welcome to nginx!** page, and change the target port to **8080**. Verify that the **Welcome to Azure Container Instances** page is being displayed.


#### Task 5: Identify and delete all lab Azure resources
  
1.   From the Azure portal, delete the  **DockerRegistryRG** resource group.
2.   From the Azure portal, delete the  **docker-machine** resource group
3.   Close all open windows.


#### Task 6: Prepare for the next lab
  
After you have completed this lab, revert the virtual machines in preparation for the next lab: 

1.   On the host computer, start Microsoft Hyper-V Manager.
2.   In the Virtual Machines list, right-click  **10992A-MIA-CL1**, and then click  **Revert**.
3.   In the  **Revert Virtual Machine** dialog box, click **Revert**.

>  **Result**: After you complete this exercise, you should have successfully deployed a private Docker registry in Azure.
